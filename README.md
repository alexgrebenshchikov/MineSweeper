# MineSweeper
Classic Minesweeper console game.

Commands:

After message "How many mines do you want on the field?", enter the number of mines.

After message "Set/unset mine marks or claim a cell as free:" you have 2 options:

Enter:
1) ```<pos X> <pos Y> mine```
  Mark cell that potentially have a mine, or remove those marks
2) ```<pos X> <pos Y> free```
  Explore a cell if you think it does not contain a mine
  
There are two possible ways to win:
  1) Marking all the cells that have mines correctly.
  2) Opening all the safe cells so that only those with unexplored mines are left.
  
 If the explored cell contains mine, game ends and you lose(
  
  Good luck:)
